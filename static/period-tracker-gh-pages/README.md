# Period Tracker

Live demo [https://electricg.github.io/period-tracker/](https://electricg.github.io/period-tracker/)


## Why

* I wanted to play with some of the cool new browser API (service workers, add to home screen, background sync, etc...)
* I wanted a light app that does exactly what I need with only a couple of tap
* I wanted the data to be easy to backup and retrieve (using Google Calendar)


## Features

* Work offline using service worker [more info](http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/service-worker/introduction/)
* Sync with Google Calendar [more info](https://developers.google.com/google-apps/calendar/overview)
* Add to Home screen [more info](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/03/increasing-engagement-with-app-install-banners-in-chrome-for-android?hl=en)
* Background sync [more info](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2015/12/background-sync?hl=en)


#### TODO
* [ ] service worker - work offline 
* [ ] background syncronisation
* [ ] use google calendar as backend server
* [ ] show error if erroring when add/update/delete
* [ ] when during event, different homescreen
* [ ] implement edit entry UI functionality
